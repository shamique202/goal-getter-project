# Goal Getter

## Introduction: 
For most college students, "busy" does not even begin to describe how frantic their lives can become, which is why they need **Goal Getter**. Students should create an organizational plan for deadlines and tasks to avoid experiencing stress. Generally, when a student is better prepared and can handle their time accordingly, it is much easier to focus their energy and attention to more important matters... like their studies! Thankfully, we have created a way to prioritze their commitments all in one location! 

## Purpose of Goal Getter:
An intuitive and motivating way to track productivity by allowing users to access and customize their assignments.
